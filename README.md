AI Password Strength Evaluator
A simple, interactive desktop application built with Kivy to evaluate the strength of passwords, generate secure passwords, and provide feedback on security metrics like brute-force resistance, adaptive security, and phishing resistance.

Features
Password Strength Checker: Analyzes your password based on length, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.
Strength Metrics: Displays password strength, estimated brute-force time, adaptive security level, and phishing resistance.
Password Generator: Creates a random, strong 12-character password with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
Clipboard Support: Copy your password to the clipboard with one click.
Visual Feedback: Includes a progress bar and color-coded strength indicators (red, yellow, green).
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Kivy for a clean, cross-platform experience.
Prerequisites
To run this application, you'll need:

Python 3.x (tested with Python 3.8+)
Kivy: A Python library for building cross-platform GUI applications.


Usage
Launch the App: Run the script as shown above, and a window titled "AI Password Strength Evaluator" will appear.
Check a Password:
Type a password into the text input field.
The app will automatically evaluate it and update the strength metrics and progress bar.
Generate a Password:
Click "Generate Strong Password" to create a random 12-character password.
A popup will display the generated password.
Copy to Clipboard:
Click "Copy to Clipboard" to copy the current password for use elsewhere.
A confirmation popup will appear.

How It Works
Strength Evaluation: The app checks for:
Length (>8 for "Strong", â‰¥6 for "Medium")
Presence of uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation.
Assigns a score (20 = Weak, 50 = Medium, 90 = Strong).
Metrics:
Brute Force Time: Estimated time to crack the password.
Adaptive Security: Resistance to adaptive hacking techniques.
Phishing Resistance: Likelihood of surviving phishing attempts.
Password Generation: Uses Python's random.choice with a mix of ASCII letters, digits, and punctuation.
Limitations
The strength evaluation is basic and heuristic-based, not a cryptographic analysis.
The app does not store or transmit passwords; all processing is local.
Requires Kivy, which may have compatibility issues on some systems.
